# local basemaps

This repo represents a proof-of-concept for serving up vector map tiles locally with the PMTiles format. I'm making use of [MapLibre's Martin server](https://github.com/maplibre/martin) via a Docker container to serve a static PMTiles basemap.

The basemap is generated by running `pmtiles extract` against a recent build of [Protomap's hosted global vector basemap](https://maps.protomaps.com/builds/). For this proof of concept I'm just loading the NYC region, all the way up to zoom 15.

## Requirements

To generate the data and run the tile server, you'll need a build of the [pmtiles cli](https://github.com/protomaps/go-pmtiles/releases), and Docker installed.

To run the front-end, you'll need a working [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) installation.

## Running vector tile server

To download basemap data and run a Docker image, simply run:

```console
make docker-run
```

Vector tiles should now be available at http://localhost:3000/nyc.pmtiles

## Running front end 

Included in this repo is a basic TypeScript + Vite [MapLibre implementation](https://maplibre.org/) that loads vector data from the locally running Martin server and renders them with [Protomaps' basemap theme](https://docs.protomaps.com/basemaps/maplibre).

First, install the dependencies with:

```
npm install
```

Then, kick off a development server with:

```
npm run dev
```

You should be able to see the map rendering at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
